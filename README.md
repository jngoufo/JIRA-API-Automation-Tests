**Project description**<br>This project, "JIRA-API-Automation-Tests," provides a collection of scripts designed to automate key processes and interactions with a JIRA user account through its API. It focuses on leveraging JIRA's powerful API to perform tasks programmatically.<br><br>**Objective**<br>The primary goal of this project is to facilitate the automation of various operations within JIRA by directly interacting with its Application Programming Interface (API). This approach allows for robust, fast, and reliable testing of JIRA functionalities without relying on the UI, making it ideal for continuous integration and rapid feedback cycles. These tests are structured and executable within the Postman environment.<br><br>**Technologies Used**<br><ul><li><b>JIRA API:</b> the core interface through which all automation is performed.</li><li><b>Postman:</b> A widely used tool for API development, testing, and documentation. This project uses Postman to organize and execute API test requests. This allows for easy management of API calls, test environments, and data.</li><li><b>JavaScript:</b> Utilized within Postman for writing pre-request scripts and test scripts. This enables dynamic data manipulation, chaining requests, setting up assertions for API responses, and controlling test flow directly within the Postman collection.</li><li><b>JSON (JavaScript Object Notation):</b> the primary data interchange format used for sending and receiving data with the JIRA API. All API requests and responses are typically handled in JSON format.</li></ul><b>Project Structure</b><br>The repository is concise, with key files relevant to API automation:<ul><li><i>JIRA Automation Test Exercises.postman_collection.json:</i> this file is the heart of the project, containing a collection of API requests, tests, and pre-request scripts, organized for automated execution within Postman.</li><li><i>README.md</i>, this file, provides an overview of the project.</li></ul>**Setup and Usage**<br>To get started with this project, you will need Postman installed and configured.<ol><li><b>Clone the Repository:</b><code>git clone https://github.com/jngoufo/JIRA-API-Automation-Tests.git cd JIRA-API-Automation-Tests</code></li><li><b>Import Postman Collection:</b><ul><li>Open Postman.</li><li>Click on "File" > "Import" or the "Import" button in the workbench.</li><li>Select the <i>JIRA Automation Test Exercises.postman_collection.json</i> file from your cloned repository.</li><li>The collection will be imported into your Postman workspace.</li></ul><li><b>Configure Environment (if necessary):</b> <ul><li>You may need to set up a Postman environment to store JIRA-specific variables like base URLs, API tokens, or user credentials. Refer to the collection details for any required variables.</li></ul><li><b>Execute Tests:</b><ul></li><li>Navigate to the imported collection in Postman.</li><li>You can run individual requests or the entire collection using the "Run Collection" feature to execute the automated API tests against your JIRA instance.</li></ul></ol>
